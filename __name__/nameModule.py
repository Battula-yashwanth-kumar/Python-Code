#__name__ is built in variable that returns us the name of the module being used.
#by using __name__ we can check weather our modules is being imported or run directly
#if we run it in the same module that is created in, then it will print "main" onto the screen; otherwise, if it is being used else where then it will print the name of its module or file it is created in.
